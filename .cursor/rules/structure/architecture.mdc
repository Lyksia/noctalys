# Project Architecture

**Objective**: Standardize the global project organization around a "feature-first" philosophy where each feature groups its components, hooks, services, and types.

**Context**: To apply for structuring projects according to a feature-first approach.

## Explanation

The project architecture follows a **feature-first** logic: each business feature is autonomous and groups everything that belongs to it (components, hooks, services, utils, data, types).

Global folders (`ui/`, `lib/`, `utils/`, `config/`, etc.) only contain what is **cross-cutting** and reusable across multiple features.

This approach improves the readability, maintainability, and scalability of the project by avoiding the dispersion of code related to the same feature.

**Global structure:**

```
├─ app/              # Next.js App Router (pages, layouts, API Routes)
├─ emails/           # Email folders (templates, config, assets)
└─ src/
  ├─ features/         # Business features (calendar, payment, etc.)
  ├─ components/
    ├─ layouts/        # Structure components (navigation, section, footer, others)
    └─ ui/             # Design system (Shadcn UI + custom components)
  ├─ lib/              # Helpers related to external libraries
  ├─ utils/            # Pure and generic utilities
  ├─ data/             # Static data (JSON, seeds)
  ├─ config/           # Global configurations
  ├─ types/            # Global TypeScript types
  └─ test/             # Test configuration and utilities
```

**Distribution logic:**

- **`features/`**: everything that belongs to a specific feature.
- **`ui/`**: global design system components.
- **`lib/`**: library-dependent functions (React Query, Zod, etc.).
- **`utils/`**: pure and independent functions.
- **`data/`**: JSON files or static data.
- **`config/`**: global configurations (env, constants, etc.).
- **`types/`**: shared global types.
- **`test/`**: test configuration and utilities (mocks, helpers).

## Practical Implementation Example

```ts
// ✅ Good: complete and autonomous feature
src/features/calendar/
  ├─ components/
  ├─ hooks/
  ├─ services/
  ├─ utils/
  ├─ data/
  ├─ types.ts
  └─ index.ts

// ❌ Bad: scattered code
src/components/calendar/
src/hooks/useCalendar.ts
src/services/calendarService.ts
```

## Variants or Exceptions

- Very small projects (< 5 features) can start with a simplified structure, but must migrate to this pattern as the project grows.
- Shared UI components (buttons, inputs, modals) live in `ui/`, not in `features/`.
